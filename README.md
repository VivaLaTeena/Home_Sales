Home Sales Data Analysis with PySpark

Overview
This repository contains code for analyzing home sales data using PySpark, a powerful analytics tool for large-scale data processing. The project focuses on employing various PySpark functionalities to derive insights from the provided home sales dataset.

Project Structure
Home_Sales_starter_code.ipynb: Initial code provided for the project.
Home_Sales.ipynb: Completed notebook containing solutions and analysis using PySpark.
partitioned_data/: Directory storing the partitioned Parquet data.
home_sales_revised.csv: Dataset used for analysis.

Project Objectives
Data Analysis using PySpark SQL Functions: Employing PySpark's SQL functionalities to derive key metrics from the home sales data.
DataFrame Operations: Utilizing DataFrame operations for filtering, aggregation, and data manipulation.
Performance Optimization: Implementing caching techniques to enhance query performance.
Data Partitioning: Partitioning and analyzing data based on the 'date_built' field.
Query Runtimes Comparison: Measuring and comparing query runtimes between cached and uncached scenarios.

How to Use
Setup: Ensure you have PySpark installed along with the required dependencies.
Notebook Execution: Run the Home_Sales.ipynb notebook to view the detailed analysis and code implementation.
Data: The raw data (home_sales_revised.csv) and partitioned Parquet data (partitioned_data/) are provided for reference.
Understanding the Code: Each section in the notebook is well-documented to explain the approach and implementation of PySpark functions.
